Music Tools - command line utilities for music composition and analysis

To install this module, use CPAN, for example:

  cpanm App::MusicTools

For the current release, see:

http://github.com/thrig/App-MusicTools

which can be installed by cloning that directory then running `cpanm .`
therein. However, if installing from the github directory, the current
versions of my various other music modules (Music::AtonalUtil,
Music::Chord::Positions, Music::LilyPondUtil, and Music::Tension) should
also be installed from github. This can be done with the script included
in this distribution thusly:

  $ sh App-MusicTools/install-music-modules

DEPENDENCIES

Some knowledge of lilypond and music theory may well benefit the user.
See the Makefile.PL for module dependencies.
